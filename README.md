## About me
Currently, I am pursuing my PhD in the Department of Statistics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from the Department of Mathematics at Shandong University. Alongside my mathematical journey, I've cultivated a profound passion for coding. My research is primarily anchored in the intersection of biological applications and statistical machine learning.
